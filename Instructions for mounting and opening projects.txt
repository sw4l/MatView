In order to open and compile the project you must run the batch file deploy drive.
This will create a Q drive that the project resides in and gives the project wide spread compatibility
for diffrent people to work on the project. 

after you deploy the drive just run Visual Studio and open the solution and it should compile. 
(you may need to retarget the windows SDK for your machine, but it shouldnt cause any problems in the long run)
